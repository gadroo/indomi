# Product Requirements Document: AI Agent for Hotel Bookings

---

## 1. Introduction

As VP of Product at Powersmy.biz, I'm thrilled to outline the requirements for our new **AI Agent for Hotel Bookings**. This document details the core functionalities, technical specifications, and success criteria for an intelligent conversational agent capable of handling hotel room bookings, rescheduling existing reservations, and answering basic hotel-related questions. This agent will primarily interact with users through Instagram DMs, providing a seamless and context-aware experience.

This initiative is a critical step in enhancing our customer engagement and leveraging cutting-edge AI to streamline common hotel interaction processes. It also serves as an exciting opportunity to onboard talented individuals passionate about conversational AI.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

The primary goals of this project are to:

* **Automate Hotel Bookings:** Enable users to book hotel rooms directly through Instagram DMs, reducing manual intervention.
* **Streamline Reservation Management:** Allow users to easily reschedule existing hotel reservations.
* **Enhance Customer Support:** Provide instant answers to frequently asked questions about hotel amenities, policies, and location.
* **Improve User Experience:** Offer a natural, context-aware, and efficient conversational interface for hotel interactions.
* **Prove Scalability & Robustness:** Demonstrate the ability to build, deploy, and manage a sophisticated, stateful AI agent using LangGraph and LLMs.

---

## 3. Core Functionality

The AI agent must provide the following core functionalities:

### 3.1 Hotel Room Booking

The agent should guide the user through the booking process, collecting all necessary details. This includes:

* **Initiation:** Recognizing intent for a new booking.
* **Information Gathering:**
    * **Check-in/Check-out Dates:** Prompting for and validating desired dates.
    * **Room Type:** Presenting available room types (e.g., standard, deluxe, suite) and collecting user preference.
    * **Number of Guests:** Collecting details on adults and children.
    * **User Contact Information:** Collecting name, email, and phone number for booking confirmation.
* **Availability Check:** (Assumed mock data for now) Simulating a check for room availability based on dates and room type.
* **Confirmation:** Summarizing booking details and asking for user confirmation before finalizing.
* **Booking ID Generation:** Providing a unique booking ID upon successful reservation.

### 3.2 Rescheduling Existing Bookings

The agent should allow users to modify their existing reservation dates. This includes:

* **Identification:** Asking for a booking ID or other identifiable information (e.g., name and original check-in date) to retrieve the existing reservation.
* **New Dates:** Prompting for and validating new check-in/check-out dates.
* **Availability Check:** (Assumed mock data for now) Simulating a check for availability for the new dates.
* **Confirmation:** Summarizing the original and new booking details, and asking for user confirmation for the reschedule.
* **Update Confirmation:** Confirming the successful update of the reservation.

### 3.3 Answering Hotel-Related Questions

The agent must be able to respond to basic queries about the hotel. Examples include:

* **Amenities:** "What amenities does the hotel offer?" (e.g., pool, gym, Wi-Fi, breakfast).
* **Check-in/Check-out Times:** "What are the check-in and check-out times?"
* **Location:** "Where is the hotel located?" or "What's the address?"
* **Cancellation Policy:** "What is your cancellation policy?"
* **Pet Policy:** "Are pets allowed?"
* **Parking Information:** "Do you have parking facilities?"

### 3.4 Conversation History and Context Management

* The agent must **maintain conversation history** to provide context-aware and relevant responses throughout the interaction. This is crucial for a natural conversational flow, allowing users to refer back to previous statements or clarify details without having to repeat information.
* **State management using LangGraph** is a key requirement for handling complex conversational flows and ensuring the agent knows where it is in the booking/rescheduling process.

---

## 4. Integration & Data Management

### 4.1 Instagram Integration

* The agent must seamlessly **integrate with Instagram DMs** using the **Instagram Graph API**.
* It should be able to **send and receive direct messages** to facilitate real-time user interaction.

### 4.2 Data Management

* **Reservation Data:** All reservation data (e.g., booking ID, guest name, contact details, check-in/check-out dates, room type, number of guests) must be stored persistently.
* **Database:** A lightweight database solution like a **JSON file or SQLite** is sufficient for this challenge.

---

## 5. Technical Requirements

### 5.1 Frameworks & LLM

* **Frameworks:** The agent must be built using **LangGraph and LangChain**. This is a non-negotiable requirement to leverage their capabilities for stateful agent development.
* **LLM:** Any LLM of choice is acceptable (e.g., **Gemini, Groq, OpenAI, Claude**). The focus is on the agent's logic and flow, not solely on LLM performance. Free-tier options are encouraged if paid APIs are not accessible.

### 5.2 API & Database

* **API:** **Instagram Graph API** for all DM interactions.
* **Database:** **JSON file or SQLite** for storing mock reservation data.

### 5.3 Robustness

* **Error Handling:** Implement robust **error handling** mechanisms for API failures (e.g., Instagram Graph API issues) and invalid user input (e.g., incorrect date formats, missing information). The agent should gracefully recover or inform the user about the issue.
* **State Management:** Explicitly leverage LangGraph for **effective conversational state management**, demonstrating a clear understanding of its capabilities for complex, multi-turn interactions.

### 5.4 Mock Data Assumption

* For the purpose of this challenge, it is assumed that **any hotel data or API responses can be mocked**. This includes mock data for hotel information, room availability, pricing, and reservation confirmations, eliminating the need for integration with actual hotel APIs.

## 6. Evaluation Criteria

The success of the AI Agent for Hotel Bookings will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

* **Functionality (40%):** Does the agent successfully and robustly handle all core functionalities (booking, rescheduling, and Q&A) as described?
* **LangGraph Implementation (25%):** Quality, clarity, and efficiency of the LangGraph state machine graph and its implementation. This includes how well conversational states and transitions are managed.
* **Code Quality (20%):** Organization, readability, efficiency, and maintainability of the source code. Adherence to good coding practices.
* **Problem-Solving & Design (10%):** Creativity and effectiveness of the approach to building the conversational flow and handling edge cases. Justification of design choices.
* **Documentation (5%):** Clarity and completeness of the `README.md`, setup instructions, architecture explanation, and the LangGraph flow diagram.
